## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to change my mindset towards the total reliance of media queries. And instead usibg best practice code to give hints to the browser to act on 

Code snippets, see below:

For example, instead of giving a command of width, max-width is sometimes a better option because it prevents overflow when the browser is reduced.


```css
h1 {
  max-width: 950px;  
}
```

### Continued development

Areas i would still have to do more extensive research is on **responsiveness of web design**. The concept is still relatively new to me and I still have issues with using the right CSS properties to get responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Kevin Powell's practical guide to responsive web design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4u1yp3Msao) - This helped change my mindset towards CSS and using media queries. It helped me understand the concept of hinting at things and letting the browser live within those constraints.
